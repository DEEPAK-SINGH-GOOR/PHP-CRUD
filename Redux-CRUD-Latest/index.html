                        // The connect is use to connects a React component to a Redux store.
                        // Payload :  Among the key components of actions is the payload, which carries data to be processed by reducers

                        1) What is Redux?
                        => Redux is a state management library used to store and manage the entire application's data in one place.
                        => It does not belong to any single component's state; it is global.
                        => Alternative to Context API for larger applications.
                        => Stores whole application data and follows unidirectional data flow.
                    
                        2) Four Main Pillars:
                        => Action, Reducer, Store, View
                           - View: React components (buttons, images, inputs, checkboxes, etc.).
                           - Action: Collects data from View & API, then sends to Reducer.
                           - Reducer: Processes action data and returns new state to Store.
                           - Store: Manages the whole application state and provides it to Views.
                        Note: One application has only one Store.
                        Flow: View → Action → Reducer → Store → View
                        
                        3) How to Install Redux:
                        => npm create vite@latest my-app
                        => npm install react-redux
                        => npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
                        => npm run dev
                    
                        4) What is Props?
                        => Props are used to send data from one component to another.
                        => Helps communicate between components.
                        Note: With Redux, components often access data directly from the Store instead of passing via props.
                    
                        5) What is Action?
                        => An object that sends data from a React component (View) or API to the Redux Store.
                    
                        6) What is Dispatch?
                        => A function in Redux used to send an action to the Store so Reducers can update the state.
                    
                        7) What is Reducer?
                        => A pure function that takes the current state and an action, and returns a new state.
                        
                        8) What is Store?
                        => The centralized container that holds the entire application’s state.
                        => Created using configureStore() in Redux Toolkit.
                        => One store per application.
                    
                        9) What is View?
                        => The UI layer (React components) that displays data from the Store and sends actions to Redux.
    
                        10) What is node-sass
                        => It enables a developer to create code in another language and translate it into CSS

                        11) What is uuid 
                        => A UUID, or Universally Unique Identifier, is a 128-bit number used to uniquely identify information in computer systems.
                        It is typically displayed as a 36-character string, divided into five sections

                        Example : 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000

                        12) What is combineReducers
                        => The combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different "slice reducer" functions into a single
                        combined reducer function you can pass to Redux

                        Example : 
                        export default combineReducers({
                        todos,
                        counter 
                        })

                        13) What is createStore
                        => Creates a Redux store that holds the complete state tree of your app
                        
                        14) What is useSelector
                        => that allows functional React components to extract and use specific pieces of data from the Redux store

                        15) What is useDispatch
                        => which allows functional components to dispatch actions to the Redux store.
                        
                        16) What is Provider 
                        => In Redux Toolkit, the Provider is a component from the react-redux library that connects your Redux store to your React
                           application. It makes the Redux store available to all components within its scope, typically by wrapping the root
                           component of your application.
